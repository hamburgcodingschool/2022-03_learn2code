# Homework for loops and for loops

## FizzBuzz

Write a program that counts and prints out from 1 to 100 on the screen.

For each number that is a multiple of 3, print 'Fizz' instead of the number, for each number that is a multiple of 5, print 'Buzz' instead of the number, and for each number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print 'FizzBuzz' instead.

```
1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, ...
```

### Stretch goal: Golf it down!

Try to make the program as short as possible. Get rid of every line break, space, tab and any characters you can spare. F\*\*K readability. Be creative. Use tricks. (Just please don't google it. You will lose your soul and your will to live.)
